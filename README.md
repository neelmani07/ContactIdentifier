The project is hosted on AWS with a database on RDS.


The API endpoint to make the request is http://35.171.25.195:8082/swagger-ui/index.html#/contact-identifier-controller/identifyContact


A small note on commits: I realized the point mentioned about regular commits only later after the completion of my project. so the repository misses the regularity of commits and appears mostly after the completion of the project. please excuse me for this.
